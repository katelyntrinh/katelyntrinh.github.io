        Before her great loch had ever been seen, shy Nessie lived life on the moors of Glenkeane.
        <br><br>She was rumored a monster, which wasn't quite right. For she was really a softie, with no
        bark, and no bite.<br><br> And with a wee friend that she had, the kind loyal and true,
        they played hide and seek in a pond just for two.</p>

        <p>Until one gloomy, gray day, at a quarter
        past two, from some distant, dark land, came a tartan-clad crew. With no time to waste, and a toot and a bugle, no expenses were spared, for tycoon MacFroogle!
