        <p><span class="big">W</span>hat begin as a trickle, soon turned to a shower. Nessie cried and she cried,
          she cried by the hour. She cried cups, and pitchers, and bottles, and buckets.
          <br><br>She cried tubs and barrels, quintets and quintuplets. For days Nessie cried, nay,
          for weeks on it went. Till one day she sniffed, her tears finally spent.</p>

          <p>In surprise she looked up, at MacQuack there, afloat? Dunkin' and bobbin' in what
          looked like... A moat, nay, 'twas a lake! A great loch! Nessie gasped in delight.
          Sure 'twas the paradise, with no golf tee in sight!</p>

        <p>Nessie learned herself a lesson
          on that bright and happy day. And it bears worth repeatin', no matter what folks may
          say. Don't ever be afraid to cry, it really is okay. <br><br> Sometimes it's through our tears,
          we find a better way. As for Nessie, and MacQuack, well, they're still there, I guess.
          Forever playing hide and seek, all along Loch Ness.</p>
